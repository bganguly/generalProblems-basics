Following is a list of some typical interview non-coding 'definition' questions seen.  
Note: If you face **only** these non-coding questions in interview (especially from 'prime vendor'  
/'implementation partner' or other companies), its a clear sign that you should  
look elsewhere , if engineering interests you even remotely.  

React:  
- Discuss first order/pure  functions vs higher order functions  
-- Hint: read about these but also be aware of current search results of these vs 
the component discussions
- general props vs state questions
- can props be set from state etc
- how to pass state from parent to child component
- discuss routing  
-- Hint: be aware of how this has evolved over the years

JS:
- event loop  
-- Hint: what is unusual (if anything) relative to other laguages  
- variable scope and resolution  
-- Hint: Discuss local/global/shadowing
