- given three bags with infinite number of balls write a function  
to maximise the number of balls possible to pick in k tries  
so maximiseBalls(number of tries, # of balls in bag A, # of balls in bag B, # of balls in bag C)  
should maximiseBalls(2,1,2,2) should return 4

- given a fixed number of cars, numbered 1 through n, and a sequence  
representing the car #'s requested, return the number of requests rejected  
thus rejectcount([1,5,5]) == 1 (car #5 can't be requested twice)
